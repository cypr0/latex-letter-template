# German Letter Template for LaTeX.

This is a clean and modern LaTeX template for German formal letters that follows roughly DIN 5008. It's primarily based on [Jan Mattfeld's](https://github.com/ljanmattfeld) awesome [template](https://github.com/janmattfeld/latex-briefvorlage).

I only use another color pattern that matches perfectly with the dark scheme of the hipster cv.

## Features
